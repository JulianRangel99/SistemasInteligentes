Blue is usually associated with water, which is made up mostly of oxygen (O2) atoms in its molecular form, as well as carbon dioxide (CO2) and other gases. When these elements combine to make visible light, the resultant blue color appears.\n\nThe specific wavelengths of light that give rise to each primary color are determined by factors such as the temperature, atmospheric conditions, and properties of the various elements involved in the light-making process. The colors that we perceive as blue (and violet) are due to the fact that blue light is the longest wavelength out of all visible light colors, with wavelengths ranging from approximately 400 nanometers (nm) to 750 nm. In general, light waves of shorter wavelengths tend to be absorbed by substances, while longer wavelengths can pass through them without being blocked or reflected.\n\nIn summary, the sky is blue because it is a combination of different colors that have the same wavelengths and lengths of radiation energy.","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[529,29989,5205,29989,29958,13,3492,526,263,8444,319,29902,20255,29889,2,29871,13,29966,29989,1792,29989,29958,13,11008,338,278,14744,7254,29973,2,29871,13,29966,29989,465,22137,29989,29958,13,1576,14744,338,7254,1363,372,338,13725,310,5164,11955,322,3161,393,505,1422,10742,2435,4141,9499,310,3578,29889,10924,338,5491,6942,411,4094,29892,607,338,1754,701,11149,310,19100,4790,264,313,29949,29906,29897,28422,297,967,13206,16637,883,29892,408,1532,408,22004,20562,5389,311,313,3217,29906,29897,322,916,10489,267,29889,1932,1438,3161,14405,304,1207,7962,3578,29892,278,1121,424,7254,2927,5692,29889,13,13,1576,2702,10742,2435,4141,9499,310,3578,393,2367,14451,304,1269,7601,2927,526,10087,491,13879,1316,408,278,10430,29892,15489,8096,293,5855,29892,322,4426,310,278,5164,3161,9701,297,278,3578,29899,28990,1889,29889,450,11955,393,591,17189,573,408,7254,313,392,5537,300,29897,526,2861,304,278,2114,393,7254,3578,338,278,27217,10742,2435,4141,29882,714,310,599,7962,3578,11955,29892,411,10742,2435,4141,9499,19120,292,515,14235,29871,29946,29900,29900,23432,8328,29879,313,22882,29897,304,29871,29955,29945,29900,302,29885,29889,512,2498,29892,3578,20037,310,20511,10742,2435,4141,9499,10331,304,367,17977,2580,491,5960,2925,29892,1550,5520,10742,2435,4141,9499,508,1209,1549,963,1728,1641,24370,470,25312,29889,13,13,797,15837,29892,278,14744,338,7254,1363,372,338,263,10296,310,1422,11955,393,505,278,1021,10742,2435,4141,9499,322,27497,310,27310,5864,29889],"total_duration":17154598807,"load_duration":8973979,"prompt_eval_count":40,"prompt_eval_duration":17451000,"eval_count":255,"eval_duration":17084809000}
